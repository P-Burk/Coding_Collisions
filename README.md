# GOAL
Bounce the ball into the blocks along the top of the screen while not letting it hit the bottom of the screen.

Deplete a block's hit points by hitting it with the ball.
If two or more balls collide, their radius is halved.
The balls' speed increases as they are reflected with the bottom block.
